Uses pywal (wal) to set colour scheme automatically in terminal, tty, and neovim. Check sway_wal.sh, sway/config, nvim/init.lua, and nvim/lua/custom/plugins.lua for info. 

To do: 
Add main settings area to toggle things, use scripts, etc. outside of fuzzel and without using waybar. Probably with eww.
Change firefox, discord, chrome, and cursor to use wal colour scheme. 
Potentially add a nice GUI based way to change wallpapers and colour schemes based on time of day, weather, mood, etc.
Potentially add sounds effects, such as a login sound, button sounds on Waybar, etc.
